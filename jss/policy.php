<h2>Terms and Conditions
<span class="postscript"><em>(v20200629.1.1)</em></span></h2>
<h3>SECTION 1 – PURPOSES OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</h3>
Digitanzo, LLC has developed the following guidelines to assist in the success of the Company and its Charter Members. These Policies and Procedures will help provide the following benefits:
<ol>
  <li>Protect the rights of all Charter Members by providing a framework within which each Charter Member may work in an ethical, effective and secure manner.</li>
  <li>Provide an equal and level playing field of opportunity to all Digitanzo Charter Members.</li>
  <li>Define the contractual relationship between Digitanzo and its Charter Members.</li>
  <li>Inform Charter Members regarding compliance issues and regulatory requirements.</li>
</ol>
Digitanzo requires that all Charter Members understand and abide by these Policies and Procedures as we work together in promoting the Digitanzo products and opportunity.
<h3>SECTION 2 – INTRODUCTION</h3>
<h4>2.1 – Policies and Procedures Incorporated into Charter Member Agreement</h4>
These Policies and Procedures, in their present form and as amended from time to time at the sole discretion of Digitanzo, LLC (“Digitanzo®” or the “Company”), are incorporated into, and form an integral part of, the Digitanzo Charter Member Agreement. Throughout these Policies and Procedures, when the term “Agreement” is used, it collectively refers to the Digitanzo Charter Member Application and the Terms and Conditions, these Policies and Procedures and the Digitanzo Compensation Plan. It is the responsibility of each Charter Member to read, understand, adhere to and ensure that he or she is aware of and operating under the most current version of these Policies and Procedures. When enrolling a new Charter Member, it is the responsibility of the Enroller to provide the most current version of these Policies and Procedures and the Digitanzo Compensation Plan to the applicant prior to his or her execution of the Charter Member Application and Agreement.
<h4>2.2 – Purpose of Policies</h4>
Digitanzo is a direct sales company that markets products through Charter Members. It is important that all Charter Members understand that their success is dependent upon the integrity of all who market Digitanzo products. To clearly define the relationship that exists between Charter Members and Digitanzo, and to explicitly set standards for acceptable business conduct, Digitanzo has established the Agreement. Digitanzo Charter Members are required to comply with all the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, as well as all federal, state and local laws governing their business and their conduct. It is very important that all Charter Members read and abide by the Agreement. Please review the information in this document carefully. It explains and governs the relationship between Charter Members and the Company. Any questions regarding any policy or rule should be directed to Digitanzo.
<h4>2.3 – Changes to the Agreement</h4>
Because federal, state and local laws, as well as the business environment periodically change, Digitanzo reserves the right to amend the Agreement (including, without limitation, the Charter Member Application and Agreement, Compensation Plan, Terms and Conditions, and Policies and Procedures) and its prices and product offering in its sole and absolute discretion. The Company shall provide or make available to all Charter Members a complete copy of the amended provisions by one or more of the following methods: (1) posting on the Company’s official website; (2) electronic mail (e-mail); (3) fax-on-demand; (4) voice mail system broadcast; (5) inclusion in Company periodicals; (6) inclusion in product orders or bonus checks; or (7) special mailings from the Company. The most current and controlling version will be located at www.Digitanzo.com. It is the responsibility of all Charter Members to regularly review www.Digitanzo.com for the most recently published amendment(s). Once the amendment(s) are published, the Charter Member(s) may elect to accept the amendment(s) or reject them. If the Charter Member rejects them, their Agreement will terminate and will not be renewed. If the Charter Member continues to purchase or sell Company products, pay monthly membership fees, enroll and/or accept rebates, commissions or bonuses from Digitanzo, such actions shall be deemed acceptance of any amendments.
<h4>2.4 – Delays</h4>
Digitanzo shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance of its obligations when performance is made commercially impracticable due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. This includes, without limitation, strikes, labor difficulties, riot, war, fire, death, curtailment of a party’s source of supply, or government decrees or orders.
<h4>2.5 – Severability</h4>
If any provision of the Agreement, in its current form or as may be amended, is found to be invalid, or unenforceable for any reason, only the invalid portion(s) of the provision shall be severed and the remaining terms and provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable provision never comprised part of the Agreement.
<h4>2.6 – Waiver</h4>
The Company never gives up its right to insist on compliance with the Agreement and with the applicable laws governing the conduct of a Charter Member. No failure of Digitanzo to exercise any right or power under the Agreement or to insist upon strict compliance by a Charter Member with any obligation or provision of the Agreement, and no custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms of the Agreement, shall constitute a waiver of Digitanzo’s right to demand exact compliance with the Agreement. Waiver by Digitanzo can be affected only in writing by an authorized officer of the Company. Digitanzo’s waiver of any particular breach by an Charter Member shall not affect or impair Digitanzo’s rights with respect to any subsequent breach, nor shall it affect in any way the rights or obligations of any other Charter Member. Nor shall any delay or omission by Digitanzo to exercise any right arising from a breach affect or impair Digitanzo’s rights as to that or any subsequent breach. The allegation or existence of any claim or cause of action of a Charter Member against Digitanzo shall not constitute a defense to Digitanzo’s enforcement of any term or provision of the Agreement.

<h3>SECTION 4 – OPERATING A DIGITANZO CHARTER MEMBERSHIP</h3>
<h4>4.1 – Adherence to the Digitanzo Compensation Plan</h4>
Charter Members must adhere to the terms of the Digitanzo Compensation Plan as set forth in official Digitanzo literature. Charter Members shall not offer the Digitanzo opportunity through, or in combination with, any other system, program, or method of marketing other than that specifically set forth in official Digitanzo literature. Charter Members shall not require or encourage other current or prospective Charter Members to participate in Digitanzo in any manner that varies from the program as set forth in official Digitanzo materials. Charter Members shall not require or encourage other current or prospective Charter Members to execute any agreement or contract other than official Digitanzo agreements and contracts in order to become a Digitanzo Charter Member. Similarly, Charter Members shall not require or encourage other current or prospective Charter Members to make any purchase from, or payment to, any individual or other entity to participate in the Digitanzo Compensation Plan other than those purchases or payments identified as recommended or required in official Digitanzo literature.
<h4>4.2 – Business Entities</h4>
A corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, or local equivalent may apply to be a Digitanzo Charter Member by submitting a Business Entity form to Digitanzo. If a Charter Member has enrolled online, such form must be submitted to Digitanzo within thirty (30) days of the online Enrollment. (If not received within the 30-day period, the Charter Member Application and Agreement shall be subject to termination.) A Digitanzo Charter Membership may change its status under the same Enroller from an individual to a partnership, corporation, trust or local equivalent or from one type of entity to another by requesting a Name Change Request Form and a Business Entity Form from the Digitanzo Compliance Department. The Business Entity form must be signed by all of the shareholders, partners, trustees, Members or owners of the relevant Business Entity. Members of the relevant Business Entity are jointly and severally liable for any indebtedness, liability or other obligation to Digitanzo.
<h4>4.3 – Minors</h4>
A person who is recognized as a minor in his or her state of residence may not be a Digitanzo Charter Member. Charter Members shall not enroll or recruit minors into the Digitanzo program.
<h4>4.4 – One Digitanzo Charter Membership per Person</h4>
Except as provided in this Section 4.4, a Charter Member may operate or have an ownership interest, legal or equitable, as a sole proprietorship, partner, shareholder, trustee, Member, owner or beneficiary, in only one Digitanzo Charter Membership. I In order to maintain the integrity of the Digitanzo Compensation Plan, spouses who wish to become separate Digitanzo Charter Members must each sign a separate Charter Member Application and Agreement.
<h4>4.4.1 – Actions of Household Members or Affiliated Individuals</h4>
If any Member of a Charter Member’s Immediate Household engages in any activity which, if performed by the Charter Member, would violate any provision of the Agreement, such activity will be deemed a violation by the Charter Member and Digitanzo may take disciplinary action pursuant to the Agreement against the Charter Member. Similarly, if any individual associated in any way with a Business Entity (collectively “Affiliated Individual”) violates the Agreement, such action(s) will be deemed a violation by the entity, and Digitanzo may take disciplinary action against the Business Entity.
<h4>4.5 – Independent Contractor Status</h4>
Charter Members are independent contractors, not employees of the Company. Charter Members are not purchasers of a franchise or a business opportunity. The Agreement between Digitanzo and its Charter Members does not create an employer/employee relationship, agency, partnership or joint venture between the Company and the Charter Member. A Charter Member is responsible for paying all applicable local, state and federal taxes due from all compensation earned as a Charter Member of the Company. A Charter Member has no authority (expressed or implied) to bind the Company to any obligation. Each Charter Member shall establish his or her own goals, hours and methods of sale, so long as he or she complies with the terms of the Agreement and all applicable laws.
<h4>4.6 – Enrolling</h4>
All active Charter Members in good standing may enroll others into the Digitanzo program. Each prospective Customer or Charter Member has the ultimate right to choose his or her own Enroller. If two Charter Members claim to be the Enroller of the same new Charter Member or Customer, the Company shall presume that the first application received by the Company is controlling.
<h4>4.7 – Changes to a Digitanzo Charter Membership</h4>
<h4>4.7.1 – General</h4>
Each Charter Member must immediately notify Digitanzo of all changes to the information contained on his or her Charter Member Application and Agreement. Charter Members may modify their existing Charter Member Application and Agreement (i.e., change Social Security number to Federal I.D. number, or change the form of ownership from an individual proprietorship to a Business Entity owned by the Charter Member) by submitting a written request for a Name Change Request Form, a properly executed Charter Member Application and Agreement, and appropriate supporting documentation. Digitanzo may, at its discretion, require notarized documents before implementing any changes to a Digitanzo Charter Membership. Please allow thirty (30) days after the receipt of the request by Digitanzo for processing.
<h4>4.7.2 – Addition of Co-Applicant</h4>
Expect as is provided in Section 4.2, only one individual may hold ownership interest in a Charter Membership.
<h4>4.7.3 – Change of Enroller</h4>
To protect the integrity of all Marketing Organizations and safeguard the hard work of all Charter Members, Digitanzo strongly discourages changes in Enrollers. Maintaining the integrity of placement is critical for the success of every Charter Member and Marketing Organization. Accordingly, the transfer request of a Digitanzo Charter Membership from one Enroller to another is subject to review and any change will be at the sole discretion of the Company.

The Charter Member seeking to transfer/change submits a properly completed and fully executed Enroller Change Request Form, which includes the written approval of his or her Enroller and immediate five (5) Enroller Upline Charter Members. Photocopied or facsimile signatures are not acceptable. The Charter Member who requests the transfer must submit a processing fee for administrative charges and data processing. Downline Charter Members will not be moved with the transferring/changing Charter Member unless all of the requirements of this section are met.

Additionally, a change of enroller will be considered in the following two (2) circumstances: In cases involving fraudulent inducement or unethical sponsoring, a Charter Member may request that he or she be transferred/changed to another organization with his or her entire Marketing Organization intact. All requests for transfer/change alleging fraudulent enrollment practices shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and will be made at the sole discretion of the Company.

Transferring/changing Charter Members must allow thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Enroller Change Request Form by Digitanzo for processing while a decision is being made.
<h4>4.7.4 – Change of Team Building Structure Sponsor</h4>
Changes to the placement of a Charter Member in the Team Building Structure are prohibited.
<h4>4.7.5 – Cancellation and Reapplication</h4>
A Charter Member may change Marketing Organizations by voluntarily cancelling his or her Digitanzo Charter Membership and remaining inactive (i.e., no purchases of Digitanzo products for resale, no sales of Digitanzo products, no enrolling, no attendance at any Digitanzo functions, participation in any other form of Charter Member activity, or operation of any other Digitanzo Charter Membership) for six (6) full calendar months. Following the six (6) month period of inactivity, the former Charter Member may reapply under a new Enroller. Digitanzo will consider waiving the six (6) month waiting period under exceptional circumstances. Such requests for waiver must be submitted to Digitanzo in writing.
<h4>4.8 – Roll-up of Marketing Organization</h4>
When a vacancy occurs in a Marketing Organization (Team) due to the termination of a Digitanzo Charter Membership, the following shall occur:
<ul>
  <li>The Marketing Organization (Team) in the Personal Enrollment Tree (PEN) will Roll-Up to the enroller of the Terminated Charter Member.</li>
  <li>The vacant position in the Team Building Structure will remain vacant with no roll-up until the position is filled by the normal activity within the direct upline. The position will be compressed (Skipped) during commission pay-outs in accordance to the Power3 Compensation Plan.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.9 – Sale, Transfer or Assignment of a Digitanzo Charter Membership</h4>
Although a Digitanzo Charter Membership is a privately owned, independently operated membership, the sale, transfer or assignment of a Digitanzo Charter Membership results in Voluntary Cancellation and is subject to certain limitations. If a Charter Member wishes to sell his or her Digitanzo Charter Membership, the following criteria must be met:
<ol>
  <li>If the buyer is an active Digitanzo Charter Member, he or she must first cancel and wait at least six (6) months before becoming eligible to purchase another Charter Membership. This requirement may be waived if the existing Digitanzo Charter Member share the same Enroller of selling Charter Member position.</li>
  <li>The transaction must be approved by Digitanzo in its sole discretion.</li>
  <li>The selling Charter Member must be in good standing and not in violation of any of the terms of the Agreement in order to be eligible to sell, transfer or assign a Digitanzo Charter Membership.</li>
  <li>Prior to selling a Digitanzo Charter Membership, the selling Charter Member must notify Digitanzo, in writing, of his or her intent to sell the Digitanzo Charter Membership. No changes in line of enrollment can result from the sale or transfer of a Digitanzo Charter Membership.</li>
  <li>The selling Charter Membership is deemed to have voluntarily Cancelled. Seller must wait for a period of six (6) months from the date of the sale, transfer or assignment of their Digitanzo Charter Membership before her or she will be eligible to again enroll as a Digitanzo Charter Member.</li>
</ol>
<h4>4.10 – Separation of a Digitanzo Charter Membership</h4>
Digitanzo Charter Members sometimes operate their Digitanzo Charter Memberships as husband and wife through a Business Entity. At such time as a marriage ends, or a Business Entity dissolves, arrangements must be made to assure that any separation or division of the Business Entity is accomplished so as not to adversely affect the interests and income of other Charter Members upline or downline of the distributorship. If the separating parties fail to provide for the best interests of other Charter Members and the Company, Digitanzo may involuntarily and immediately terminate the Agreement. Under no circumstances will the Downline of divorcing or legally separating spouses or a dissolving Business Entity be divided based on the requests or desires of the divorcing or legally separating parties. Similarly, under no circumstances will Digitanzo split commission and bonus checks between divorcing or legally separating spouses or Members of dissolving Business Entities. Digitanzo will recognize only one downline and will issue only one commission check per Digitanzo Charter Membership per commission cycle. Commission payments shall be issued to the individual or Business Entity on the Membership. In the event that parties to a divorce or dissolution proceeding are unable to resolve a dispute over the disposition of commissions and ownership of the Charter Membership, commissions will continue to be paid to the Member on the account. If a former spouse or a former Affiliated Individual has completely relinquished all rights in their original Digitanzo Charter Membership, they are thereafter free to Enroll under any Enroller of their choosing, so long as they meet the waiting period requirements set forth in Section 4.7.5. In such case, however, the former spouse or partner shall have no rights to any downline in their former Marketing Organization. The former spouse or partner must develop the new Marketing Organization in the same manner as would any other new Charter Member.
<h4>4.11 – Succession</h4>
Upon the death of or incapacitation of a Charter Member, his or her Charter Membership may be passed to his or her heirs. Appropriate legal documentation must be submitted to the Company to ensure the transfer is proper. Accordingly, a Charter Member should consult an attorney to assist him or her in the preparation of a will or other testamentary instrument. Whenever a Digitanzo Charter Membership is transferred by a will or other testamentary process, the legal successor in interest acquires the right to collect all Financial Distributions (as defined in Section 12) of the deceased Charter Member’s Marketing Organization provided the following qualifications are met.

The successor(s) in interest must:
<ol>
  <li>Execute a Charter Member Application and Agreement;</li>
  <li>Comply with terms and provisions of the Agreement;</li>
  <li>Meet all of the qualifications for the deceased Charter Member‘s status;</li>
  <li>Financial Distributions of a Digitanzo Charter Membership transferred pursuant to this Section 4.11 will be paid in a single check jointly to the legal successor(s) in interest. Such successor(s) must provide Digitanzo with an “address of record” to which all Financial Distributions checks will be sent.</li>
  <li>If the Charter Membership is bequeathed to multiple legal successors in interest, they must form a Business Entity and acquire a federal taxpayer identification number. Digitanzo will issue all Financial Distributions and a Form 1099 as required by the IRS.</li>
</ol>
<h4>4.12 – Transfer Upon Death of a Charter Member</h4>
To effect a testamentary transfer of a Digitanzo Charter Membership, the successor in interest must provide the following to Digitanzo:
<ol>
  <li>A certified copy of the death certificate;</li>
  <li>A notarized copy of the will or other instrument establishing the successor’s right to the Digitanzo Charter Member account; and</li>
  <li>A completed and executed Charter Member Application and Agreement.</li>
</ol>
If the successor in interest is already a Digitanzo Charter Member, the Company may grant exception to the one Member Account per Person rule upon written request from the successor in interest.
<h4>4.13 – Transfer Upon Incapacitation of a Charter Member</h4>
To effect a transfer of a Digitanzo Charter Membership because of incapacity, a legally appointed representative must provide the following to Digitanzo: (1) a notarized copy of an appointment as trustee or other legally appointed representative; (2) a notarized copy of the trust document or other documentation establishing the trustee’s right to administer the Digitanzo Charter Membership; and (3) a completed Charter Member Application and Agreement executed by the trustee. If the representative in interest is already a Digitanzo Charter Member, the Company may grant exception to the Member Account per Person rule upon written request from the representative in interest.
<h4>4.14 – Errors or Questions</h4>

Examples of such contact and communication may include, but are not limited to: newsletters, written correspondence, personal meetings, telephone contact, voice mail, electronic mail and the accompaniment of downline Charter Members to Digitanzo meetings, training sessions and other functions. Successful upline Charter Members also motivate and train new Charter Members in Digitanzo product knowledge, effective sales techniques, the Digitanzo Compensation Plan and compliance with the Company Policies and Procedures.

Upon request by Digitanzo, every Charter Member should be able to provide documented evidence to Digitanzo of his or her ongoing efforts as a mentor and an Enroller.
<h4>5.2.2 – Increased Training Responsibilities</h4>

They may be called upon from time to time to share this knowledge with lesser experienced Charter Members within their Marketing Organization.

If Cross-Sponsoring is discovered, it must be brought to the Company’s attention immediately. Digitanzo may take action against the Charter Member who changed Marketing Organizations and/or those Charter Members who encouraged or participated in the Cross-Sponsoring.

However, Digitanzo is under no obligation to move the Cross-Sponsored Charter Member’s Downline Organization, and the ultimate disposition of the Marketing Organization remains within the sole discretion of Digitanzo.

The term “established business or personal relationship” means prior or existing relationship formed by a voluntary two-way communication between a Charter Member and a person, on the basis of: (1) an inquiry, application, purchase or transaction by the person regarding products offered by such Charter Member; or (2) a personal or familial relationship, which relationship has not been previously terminated by either party.
<h4>8.7 – Telemarketing</h4>
The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as other applicable local authorities, each have regulations that restrict telemarketing practices. Many authorities have “do not call” regulations as part of their telemarketing laws. Although Digitanzo does not consider Charter Members to be “telemarketers” in the traditional sense of the word, these government regulations broadly define the term “telemarketer” and “telemarketing” so that a Distributor’s inadvertent action of calling someone whose telephone number is listed on a “do not call” registry could cause them to violate the law. Moreover, these regulations must not be taken lightly, as they can carry significant penalties and fines, per violation. Therefore, Charter Members must not engage in telemarketing in the operation of their Digitanzo Charter Membership. The term “telemarketing” means the placing of one or more telephone calls to an individual or entity to induce the purchase of a Digitanzo product or service, or to recruit them for the Digitanzo opportunity. “Cold calls” made to prospective customers or Charter Members that promote either Digitanzo’s products or services or the Digitanzo opportunity constitute telemarketing and are prohibited. In addition, Charter Members shall not use automatic telephone dialing systems or random phone lists relative to the operation of their Digitanzo Charter Memberships. The term “automatic telephone dialing system” means equipment which as the capacity to: (1) store or produce telephone numbers to be called using a random or sequential number generator; and (2) to dial such numbers. In addition, Charter Members acknowledge and agree to abide by telemarketing guidelines.
<h4>8.8 – Advertised Product Price</h4>
Charter Members may not advertise Digitanzo products at a price LESS than the suggested retail price of one (1) unit of the Digitanzo product. Charter Members also agree that all advertising regarding the price of Products will be truthful and will not contain misleading statements (e.g. “lowest price available” which infers that a Charter Member is able to sell the Products at a lower price than other Charter Members, etc.). Any violation of this Section 8.8 by a Charter Member shall constitute a breach of the Agreement and may result in punitive action including, but not limited to, any of the actions set forth in Section 14.
<h3>SECTION 9 – RULES AND REGULATIONS</h3>
<h4>9.1 – Identification</h4>
All Charter Members are required to provide their Social Security Number, Federal Employer Identification Number, or equivalent government issued identification number, to Digitanzo on the Charter Member Application and Agreement. Upon enrollment, the Company will provide a unique Charter Member Identification Number to the Charter Member by which he or she will be identified. This number will be used to place orders and track financial distributions.
<h4>9.2 – Income Taxes</h4>
Each Charter Member is responsible for paying all applicable local, state, and federal taxes on any income generated as a Charter Member. If a Charter Membership is tax exempt, the Federal tax identification number must be provided to Digitanzo. Every year, Digitanzo will provide an IRS Form 1099 MISC (Non-employee Compensation) earnings statement to each U.S. distributor who: (1) had earnings of over $600 in the previous calendar year; (2) made purchases during the previous calendar year in excess of $5,000; or (3) earned an incentive award trip.
<h4>9.3 – Insurance</h4>
<h4>9.3.1 – Business Pursuits Coverage</h4>
Digitanzo Charter Members may wish to arrange insurance coverage for their Membership. Often a homeowner’s insurance policy does not cover business-related injuries or the theft of or damage to inventory or business equipment. Charter Members should contact their insurance agent to make certain that their relevant property is protected. In the U.S., this can often be accomplished with a simple “Business Pursuit” endorsement attached to their present homeowner’s policy.
<h4>9.4 – International Marketing</h4>
Charter Members are authorized to enroll Customers, or Charter Members only in countries in which Digitanzo is authorized to conduct business as announced in Official Digitanzo Materials or on the Company website.
<h4>9.4.1 – International Marketing Definitions</h4>
<h4>9.4.1.1 – Un-Authorized Markets (Pre-Market)</h4>
Prior to the official opening of a country, permissible Charter Member activity is limited to providing business cards and conducting, organizing or participating in meetings with no more than five (5) attendees, including the Charter Member. Other attendees must be personal acquaintances or acquaintances of personal acquaintances. These meetings must be held in a home or a public establishment but may not be held in a private hotel room. Charter Member Pre-Market opening conduct prohibited in all markets includes but is not limited to:

9.4.1.1.1 – All cold-calling techniques (soliciting persons who are not prior personal acquaintances of the contacting Charter Member) are strictly prohibited in unauthorized markets;

9.4.1.1.2 – Importing or facilitating the importation of, selling, gifting or distributing in any manner, Company products, services or product sample(s);

9.4.1.1.3 – Placing any type of advertisement or distributing any promotional materials regarding the Company, its products or the opportunity, except for official Digitanzo material specifically authorized for distribution in unopened markets as designated by the Company;

9.4.1.1.4 – Soliciting or negotiating any agreement for the purpose of committing a citizen or resident of an unopened market to the opportunity, a specific Enroller or specific line of sponsorship. Furthermore, Charter Members may not sign up a citizen or resident of unopened markets in an Authorized Country or by using the Charter Member Agreement forms from an Authorized Country, unless the citizen or resident of the unopened market has, at the time of sign-up, permanent residence and the legal authorization to work in the Authorized Country. It is the enrolling Charter Member’s responsibility to ensure compliance with residency and work authorization requirements. Membership or participation in, or ownership of a corporation, partnership or other legal entity in an Authorized County does not by itself fulfill the residency or legal authorization to work requirements. If a participant to a Charter Membership fails to provide verification of residency and work authorization when requested by the Company, the Company may, at its election, declare the Distributor Agreement void from its inception;

9.4.1.1.5 – Accepting money or other consideration, or being involved in any financial transaction with any potential Charter Member either personally or through an agent, for purposes relating to Company products or the opportunity, including renting, leasing or purchasing facilities for the purpose of promoting or conducting Company-related business;

9.4.1.1.6 – Promoting, facilitating or conducting any type of activity which exceeds the limitations set forth in the Company’s Policies and Procedures or which the Company, in its sole discretion, deems to be contradictory to the Company’s business or ethical interests in international expansion.
<h4>9.4.1.2 – Not-For-Resale (“NFR”)</h4>
Countries where residents of the country are allowed to import products for personal use only on a “not-for-resale” basis, but where the reselling of those products is prohibited.
<h4>9.5 – Adherence to Laws and Ordinances</h4>
<h4>9.5.1 – Local Ordinances</h4>
There are laws regulating certain home-based businesses. In most cases these ordinances are not applicable to Digitanzo Charter Members because of the nature of their Charter Memberships. However, Charter Members must obey those laws that do apply to them. If a government official tells a Charter Member that an ordinance applies to him or her, the Charter Member shall be polite and cooperative, and immediately send a copy of the ordinance to Digitanzo. In most cases there are exceptions to the ordinance that may apply to Digitanzo Charter Members.
<h4>9.5.2 – Compliance with Applicable Laws</h4>
Charter Members shall comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations in the conduct of their Charter Memberships.
<h4>9.5.2.1 – Anti-Corruption Laws</h4>
Charter Members must comply with all anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) in the markets in which the Company does business. The FCPA requires that you never directly or indirectly (i.e. through a third party) make a payment or gift with the purpose of influencing the acts or decisions of foreign officials. There are some limited exceptions to this rule. Because the rules and exceptions relating to anti-corruption are complex, you should consult with your own legal counsel regarding questions relating to compliance with the FCPA or anti-corruption laws. For additional information regarding the Company’s policy on this matter, please refer to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
<h3>SECTION 10 – SALES</h3>
<h4>10.1 – Commercial Outlets</h4>
Digitanzo strongly encourages the retailing and selling of its products through person-to-person contact. In an effort to reinforce this method of marketing and to help provide a standard of fairness for its Charter Member base, Charter Members may not display or sell Digitanzo products or literature in any retail establishment. Charter Members may, however, sell Digitanzo products from service establishments which see customers or clients on an appointment basis only such as hair salons, spas or chiropractic clinics, etc. Digitanzo will permit Charter Members to solicit and make commercial sales upon prior written approval from the Company. The term “commercial sale” means the sale of Digitanzo products to a third party who intends to resell such products to an end consumer.
<h4>10.2 – Trade Shows, Expositions and Other Sales Forums</h4>
Charter Members may display and/or sell Digitanzo products at trade shows and professional expositions. Before submitting a deposit to the event promoter, Charter Members must contact the Company in writing for conditional approval, as Digitanzo’s policy is to authorize only one Digitanzo Charter Member per event. Final approval will be granted to the first Charter Member who submits an official advertisement of the event, a copy of the contract signed by both the Charter Member and the event official, and a receipt indicating that a deposit for the booth has been paid. Approval is given only for the event specified. Any requests to participate in future events must again be submitted to the Compliance Department. Digitanzo further reserves the right to refuse authorization to participate at any function which it does not deem a suitable forum for the promotion of its products, services or the Digitanzo opportunity. Approval will not be given for swap meets, garage sales, flea markets or farmer’s markets, as these events are not conducive to the professional image Digitanzo wishes to portray.

Charter Members must deposit or cash rebate, commission and bonus checks within (6) six months from their date of issuance. A check that remains uncashed after six (6) months will be void. There shall be a $25.00 charge for reissuing a check.

From time to time, the Company may provide incentive trips and other awards to qualified Charter Members. These awards or trips may be based on title and high Charter Member performance and are provided only to the person(s) listed on a qualifying Charter Member Agreement.

The Charter Member cannot make claim upon, or rely upon, any insurance policy of the Company to cover the costs and expenses of any injury, loss or other damage to the Charter Member and/or the Charter Member’s guests. The Company may be required by law to include the fair market value of any incentive awards, trips, etc. on the Charter Member’s end of the year tax report. The Charter Member is liable for all applicable taxes and agrees to hold the Company harmless from claims of tax liability relating to these incentive trips and awards.

The Company reserves the right at its sole and absolute discretion to disallow participation for any reason it deems necessary.
<h4>11.5 – Reports</h4>

<h4>11.5.1 – Downline Reports</h4>

<h4>12.1 – Non-Subscription and Subscription Customers</h4>
Charter Members are encouraged to promote Digitanzo’s Non-Subscription Customer and Subscription Customer programs to their customers. Both Subscription and Non-Subscription Customers can purchase their products directly from Digitanzo. Customers simply call Digitanzo’s toll-free order number to place their orders, which they may charge to their credit card. Digitanzo will send the ordered products directly to the customer. To ensure that Charter Members receive the appropriate commissions, Non-Subscription Customer and Subscription Customer may not place an order without a Charter Member’s Identification Number.

<h4>12.2 – General Order Policies</h4>
On mail orders with invalid or incorrect payment, Digitanzo will attempt to contact the Charter Member or Customer by phone and/or mail to try to obtain another payment.

Digitanzo maintains no minimum order requirements. Orders for products and sales aids may be combined.
<h4>12.3 – Shipping and Back Order Policy</h4>

A Charter Member and/or recipient of an order must confirm that the product received matches the product listed on the shipping invoice and is free of damage.

<h2>Cookies Policy
<span class="postscript"><em>v20190829.1.1</em></span></h2>
r network LLC, and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, r network or "us") respect your concerns about privacy. r network obtains certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies (collectively "Cookies") when you visit, access, or use our websites and mobile sites, that link to this Cookie Policy (collectively the "Sites"). This Cookie Policy explains how we use Cookies, their purposes, and how you can control them.
<h4>What are Cookies?</h4>
A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Cookies are generally used to help improve your experiences on the site, by, for instance, remembering your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

They are also used by website owners to make improvements to the site based on the visitors behavior. In some cases they are used to collect and store information about specific users.

A web beacon, also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and may be used to transmit information collected through Cookies back to a web server.
<h4>How Do We Use Cookies?</h4>
Below is a list of the categories of Cookies that we use on our Sites.
<ol>
  <li>
<h4>Essential Cookies</h4>
These cookies are essential for the proper functioning of the website and cannot be disabled in our systems. These are usually only posted in response to certain actions you take, for example a request for a service, such as setting up your privacy preferences, logging in or filling out a form. Without these cookies we cannot deliver certain parts of our website or the requested service.</li>
  <li>
<h4>Performance Cookies</h4>
We use performance cookies to collect information about your choices or remember your preferences so we can show you relevant content. These cookies allow us to remember, amongst others, your browsing language, contrast color, font size, device used, search results preferences and notification preferences. Performance cookies can be set up by us or by a third party whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow performance cookies, some or all services will not work properly.</li>
  <li>
<h4>Analytics Cookies</h4>
We use analytics cookies to collect information on how users navigate and use our Sites, such as how the users traverse our Sites, the pages they view, how long they stay on a page and whether the page is displayed correctly or whether errors occur. Such cookies help us to improve the performance of our Sites and make the Sites more user-friendly. Also, some videos embedded in our Sites use a cookie to anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited. Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the Sites to work but it will provide you with a better browsing experience. You can deny or delete these cookies, but if you do some features of the Sites may not work as intended.</li>
  <li>
<h4>Social Media and Advertising Cookies</h4>
Social media cookies offer the possibility to connect you to your social networks and share content from our website through social media. Advertising cookies (of third parties) collect information to help better tailor advertising to your interests, both within and beyond r network websites. In some cases, these cookies involve the processing of your personal data. For more information about this processing of personal data, check our Online Privacy Notice. De-selecting these cookies may result in seeing advertising that is not as relevant to you or you not being able to link effectively with Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks and/or not allowing you to share content on social media.</li>
</ol>
<h4>How to Control Cookies</h4>
To adjust your cookies settings with r network, please visit the Cookies Settings at the bottom of your webpage.

In addition, you can delete all Cookies that are already on your device and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed.

On Microsoft Internet Explorer, this can be done by selecting Tools/Internet Options and reviewing your privacy settings or selecting delete Cookies. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking help on your browsers menu or by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device. Please note, however, that without Cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Sites or our products or services. You may, for example, have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a Site and some services and functionalities may not work.

For a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of every third-party accessing your web browser (through r network Sites or otherwise), we recommend installing a web browser plugin built for this purpose. You can also choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings on each browser and device that you use. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
